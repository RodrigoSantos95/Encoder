## About the project 

<p justify-content: center>This project consisted in convert vowels into words in order to enconder any texts one may wanted. These convertions were called keys.

The keys used were:

```The vowel "a" is converted to "ai"```<br>
```The vowel "e" is converted to "enter"```<br>
```The vowel "i" is converted to "imes"```<br>
```The vowel "o" is converted to "ober"```<br>
```The vowel "u" is converted to "ufat"```

And also the writer must follow some rules in order to reach the message codified.<br>
* Only write using lowercase words
* May not use accented words or special characters
*It may be possible to convert some letter to the encripted version and also, to return the encripted version into the origial one, for example:

```home => hobermenter```

```mimesraiclenter => miracle```
